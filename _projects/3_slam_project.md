## Motivation

Indoor environments change frequently, making conventional maps quickly outdated. This project develops a SLAM system that focuses on persistent structures to produce clean, long-lasting maps for dependable lifelong indoor navigation.

## Method Overview

The system applies real-time **vertical plane segmentation** on 3D LiDAR using RANSAC to extract large structural surfaces (e.g., walls) and filter out transient objects.

    height: 300px;
    width: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
}
</style>

<div class="row equal-height-images">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/slam_original_map.jpg" title="Original SLAM Map" class="rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/slam_filtered_map.jpg" title="Map After Vertical Plane Segmentation" class="rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

After isolating structural planes, the 3D point cloud is projected into a 2D laser scan, enabling the use of mature 2D SLAM (e.g., Gmapping) to build efficient, structure-consistent maps.

## From Simulation to Reality: Proving the Concept

We validated the approach in Gazebo simulation and real laboratory corridors with transient obstacles, consistently producing clean structural maps in real time.

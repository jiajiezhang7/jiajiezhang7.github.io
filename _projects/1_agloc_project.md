## Project Overview

AGLoc++ is a significant extension of the AGLoc system previously published in RAL 2023. The original AGLoc system proposed a robust indoor localization method using 3D LiDAR and hierarchical topo-semantic Area Graphs, achieving long-term stable performance in office environments by filtering dynamic clutter and matching architectural features (e.g., walls/doors), outperforming traditional SLAM approaches.

This project enhances the previous work in the following key aspects:

## Key Technologies

### 1. Long-term LiDAR Localization Framework
Global and local localization framework based on hierarchical Area Graph, enabling robust localization in dynamic indoor environments.

### 2. Clutter-adaptive Subsampling
Filters transient objects (e.g., furniture, pedestrians) from 3D LiDAR point clouds, preserving structural features (walls, doors).

### 3. Hypothesis-scoring Global Localization
Addresses the kidnapped robot problem: samples candidate poses, ranks via novel Area Graph match metric, and refines for reliability.

### 4. Weighted Point-to-line ICP
Weighted point-to-line ICP with clutter-aware weight function, ensuring pose tracking relies solely on lifelong architectural features.

### 5. Corridorness-aware Downsampling
Optimizes point cloud registration in corridor-dominated spaces, improving ICP accuracy.

## About Me

I am a graduate student at ShanghaiTech University pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology. Since 2023, I have been conducting research at the [MARS Lab](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) (Mobile Autonomous Robotics Systems Laboratory) at ShanghaiTech University, advised by [Professor Soeren Schwertfeger](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/people/soeren), focusing on cutting-edge areas including **Mobile Robotics** and **Embodied AI**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence, with particular emphasis on:
- **Intelligent Navigation Systems**: Developing robust navigation algorithms that integrate semantic understanding with traditional path planning
- **SLAM and Mapping**: Creating long-term, lifelong mapping solutions for dynamic indoor environments
- **Embodied AI**: Bridging the gap between large language models and robotic systems for enhanced human-robot interaction

## Recent Work

I am currently working on several exciting projects that push the boundaries of mobile robotics:

**LLM-Enhanced Navigation**: My recent work on integrating Large Language Models with traditional ROS navigation stack has been accepted at **IROS 2025**. This research demonstrates how contextual understanding can significantly improve robot navigation in complex environments.

**Neural Scene Reconstruction**: I have contributed to advancing 3D scene mapping through neural surfel-based methods, addressing critical challenges in loop closure and large-scale reconstruction. This work was published in **MDPI Sensors** in 2024.

**AGLoc++ System**: I am extending previous work on robust indoor localization by incorporating WiFi-aided recovery and Monte Carlo tracking, making the system more practical for real-world deployment.

## Background

Before joining ShanghaiTech University, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Automation at Zhengzhou University (2019-2023), where I developed a strong foundation in control systems, signal processing, and robotics fundamentals.

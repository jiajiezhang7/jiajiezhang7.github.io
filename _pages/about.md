## About Me

I am a graduate student at ShanghaiTech University pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology. Since 2023, I have been conducting research at the [MARS Lab](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) (Mobile Autonomous Robotics Systems Laboratory) at ShanghaiTech University, advised by [Professor SÃ¶ren Schwertfeger](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/people/soeren), focusing on cutting-edge areas including **Mobile Robotics** and **Embodied AI**. Prior to joining ShanghaiTech University, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Automation at Zhengzhou University (2019-2023), where I developed a strong foundation in control systems, signal processing, and robotics fundamentals.

My research interests lie in how embodied agents learn efficiently from limited supervision in continual, open-world settings and how to ground large foundation models in the physical world. My goal is to build fundamental algorithms that learn from unbounded data streams and endow agents with robust, physically grounded interaction skills.

## Recent Work

I am currently working on several exciting projects:

**AGLoc++ System(Master Thesis)**: I am extending previous work on robust indoor localization by incorporating WiFi-aided recovery and Sensor Fusion tracking leveraging osmAG, solving the robot kidnapping problem, making the system product-level practical for real-world deployment.

**Latent Action Tokenizer For VLM Pretraining**: I am working on a novel, unsupervised pipeline that is automatically segmenting continuous, unstructured industrial videos into meaningful action primitives for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model latent pre-training by defining and detecting semantic boundaries in a latent action representation space.

Feel free to explore my [publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) to learn more about my research contributions, or check out my [CV](/cv/) for detailed academic information.

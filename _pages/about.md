## About Me

I am a graduate student at ShanghaiTech University pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology. Since 2023, I have been conducting research at the [MARS Lab](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) (Mobile Autonomous Robotics Systems Laboratory) at ShanghaiTech University, advised by [Professor Sören Schwertfeger](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/people/soeren), focusing on cutting-edge areas including **Mobile Robotics** and **Embodied AI**. Prior to joining ShanghaiTech University, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Automation at Zhengzhou University (2019-2023), where I developed a strong foundation in control systems, signal processing, and robotics fundamentals.

My research interests lie in how embodied agents learn efficiently from limited supervision in continual, open-world settings and how to ground large foundation models in the physical world. My goal is to build fundamental algorithms that learn from unbounded data streams and endow agents with robust, physically grounded interaction skills.

## Recent Work

**AGLoc++ (My Master Thesis)**: I am extending previous work on robust and cross-level indoor localization by incorporating WiFi-aided recovery and Sensor Fusion tracking leveraging [OSMAG](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10354976), solving the robot kidnapping problem, making the system product-level practical for real-world deployment.

**OSMAG-Navigation Stack**: I am currently working with my teammates to build a full-stack navigation software package based on [OSMAG](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10354976). This package includes a suite of ready-to-deploy, real-world-applicable algorithms such as [automatic OSMAG map generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00552), [OSMAG-based LiDAR localization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10321673), and efficient hierarchical path planning. It will be fully compatible with [Navigation2](https://docs.nav2.org/) and addresses several persistent challenges in existing mature mobile robot navigation stacks, including: the prohibitively large memory footprint of occupancy grid maps, which limits large-scale generation and deployment; the computational inefficiency and high resource consumption of grid-map-based path planning algorithms; and the inability to navigate across floors or between buildings. We hope this will be a meaningful contribution to the Mobile Robotics community!
